-- build a list of all the positive integers less than 100
-- that are multiples of 3 *or* 5


-- write a function that takes two lists returns a new list
-- by removing the contents of the second list from the first


-- write a function that accepts two lists of numbers and
-- returns a list of each number in the first list repeating as much
-- as specified by each number of the second list
-- Example: for the lists [3,8,1] and [0,2,3] the function should
-- return the following lists:
--      [], [3,3], [3,3,3]
--      [], [8,8], [8,8,8]
--      [], [1,1], [1,1,1]
--
-- To avoid someone accidentally creating a GIGANTIC list, the function
-- should ignore any lists longer than 20 elements
--


-- write a function that censors every string in a list by replacing
-- the vowels in them with *
--
-- For good measure, it should remove the string "dingleberry" from
-- the list, if it appears
--
