-- Write a function to tell whether a triangle
-- is big or not. A triangle should be called
-- big if its hypoteneuse is longer than 10.
--    (be sure to use where to make your function

bigTriangle :: Float -> Float -> Bool
bigTriangle length width = undefined

-- Write a function that classifies rectangles
-- into at least 5 size categories based their
-- area. The pair given is the rectangle's length
-- and width.
rectSize :: (Integer, Integer) -> String
rectSize = undefined

-- Write a function that constructs a rect from a
-- list of 2 elements, length and width. Assume
-- there will always be exactly 2 elements
-- in the list. Use your where and pattern
-- matching skills to write the most readable
-- function you can.
listToRect :: [Integer] -> (Integer, Integer)
listToRect = undefined

-- Write a function that calculates the area of
-- each rectangle in a list.
