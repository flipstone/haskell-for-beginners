-- Write a function to tell whether a triangle

-- Write a function that constructs a rect from a
-- list of 2 elements, length and width. Assume
-- there will always be exactly 2 elements
-- in the list. Use your *let* and pattern
-- matching skills to write the most readable
-- function you can.

-- Write a function that calculates the area of
-- each rectangle in a list. Write two versions
-- of it, one with with let *outside* the list,
-- and one with let *inside* the list.


-- Write a function to calculate the area of a
-- square donut based on its size and thickness.
-- For instance, the square below has size 5,
-- thinkness 1, area 16.
