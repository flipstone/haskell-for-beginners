-- For all the functions you define in these problems,
-- write the type signature before you start writing
-- the definition.

-- Define a function that applies another function
-- to each element of a pair.


-- Use your function above to write a function
-- that scales (multiplies) a pair by a given
-- factor.


-- Define a function that applies a function to
-- each element of a list.


-- Use your functions above to define a function that
-- scales every pair in a list of pairs by ten.


-- Define a function that accepts a function and an
-- initial value. It should return the list of values
-- produced by repeatedly applying the function to its
-- own return value.


-- Use your functions above to define a function that
-- takes a pair and returns a list of all (infinitely many)
-- pairs by scaling that pair by powers of ten.
